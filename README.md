# bugzilla2jira

Import bugzilla bugs in JIRA

Simply script to read bugs from Bugzilla and create the corresponding issues in
JIRA, so you can have both tools synced.

The tool is customized to our environment where we need to do http basic auth
against the bugzilla API endpoint and we use a label in JIRA to match the
product in Buzilla. 

It uses a config file to specify the following parameters:

* Bugzilla url, user, password and product.

* JIRA url, user, password, project and product. The product is a label in JIRA.

All the bugs details and bug comment history will be saved to json files.

### Example

```
python bz2jira.py -c config
